This dictionary in its initial form was created as a deliverable of a two-day 
seminar at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies “Artes Librales” (IBI AL) 
at the University of Warsaw, on "XML for linguists/lexicographers", taught by 
Piotr Bański in November/December 2010.

Many thanks to dr. Natalia Kotsyba (the organizer) and the participating students.
The initial version was created by Oleksii Batarchuk.
