Swahili-English and English-Swahili xFried Dictionary

This Dictionary is based on Swahili-Kiswahili to English 
Translation Program by Morris Fried (www.dict.org/links.html), 
which has been supplemented by entries from an older version
of the Freedict Swahili-English Dictionary
created by Horst Eyermann (http://www.freedict.de) from 
the Swahili-Esperanto and Esperanto-English Ergane dictionaries (http://www.travlang.com).
The conversion of Fried's dictionary to DICT format and merging 
it with Eyermann's Ergane-based dictionary
has been done, with some help of Computer Science colleagues,
by Beata Wojtowicz (wierzchob@wp.pl) in June 2004.
