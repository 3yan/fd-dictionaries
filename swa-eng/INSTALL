You should be able to see the contents of the dictionary thanks 
to the schema files (DTD and RNG) and the style sheet (CSS).
This is only a working view, with some of the text supplied by the CSS
 -- that's why copying from the browser won't yield the results you'd
expect.

One way to access the dictionary properly is to use the DICT database 
generated from the TEI source. The database is offered in a separate 
download and it can be accessed online, e.g. at

* http://dict.uni-leipzig.de/dictd (official Freedict WWW front-end)

* http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict (official DICT WWW front-end)

(make sure to check the version of the dictionary: these online 
repositories may offer earlier versions!)

You can also download a desktop/plugin client, see 

* http://www.dict.org/w/software/software for a long list, and
* https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/freedict/index.php?title=DICT_clients for a short one.

Very often, you will have to tell the client which DICT server it 
should use; look for "Freedict" in the server description. The relatively
current list of Freedict servers that identified themselves to us is
available at http://luetzschena-stahmeln.de/dictd/index.php?freedictonly

Apart from using DICT databases online, you can also access them on your own 
computer. To do that, you will generally need to run a server (don't worry, 
they are small programs; see the list at http://www.dict.org/w/software/software or
https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/freedict/index.php?title=DICT_servers and 
choose something suitable for your platform) and set the client to use the localhost,
rather than an online server.
