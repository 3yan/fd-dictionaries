# Test space

This directory contains two files:
- example_entries.xml - a collection of entries coming from various Freedict dictionaries
- example_entries_c5.txt - the result of applying the Freedict stylesheets to these entries, in order to produce the c5 format, which is further used to create DICT databases

The XML file serves two purposes: as a selective overview of TEI XML structures that may serve as 'live' examples for encoders and as  a seed for our hopefully emerging test suite.
