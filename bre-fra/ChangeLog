  * minor fixes in Makefile and the source, to make it
    work with the Freedict pipeline; added ChangeLog
  * maintenance release: 0.2.9 (I believe that a more correct 
    version number should be something like 0.8.1)

        Some words added, corrections and mark up improvments: sense/cit(without attribute)
        and cit@subtype for literal translation. All the regular plurals have been marked
        up, some irregular plurals may still be in lbl tag. Next steps will be to merge
        entries with the same headword (number of character is one of the freelang file
        limits) and to remove redundant infos (ie there are two entries for a-dreuz: a-dreuz
        and dreuz (a-)).</change>

        Some words added (mostly computer sciences words). Mark up improvments. Additions
        could be entry, sense or cit. All of those additions have been marked with attribute
        who and sometimes src. Some entries, sense or cit have been marked with rev
        attribute, meaning to be reviewed.</change>
