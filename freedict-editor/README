I can try to make some Gnome libs optional (thinking of gconf and libgtkhtml presently).

  Description     : OCaml bindings for GtkSourceView                                                
                                                                                                    
  LablGtkSourceView are the OCaml bindings for GtkSourceView, a GTK widget                            
  which extends the standard GTK text widgets implementing syntax                                     
  highlighting, automatic indentation, and other typical features of                                  
  source editors.                                                                                     
                                                                                                      
  Using LablGtkSourceView you can instantiate and use GtkSourceView                                   
  widgets in OCaml programs which use GTK through the LablGtk interface.
