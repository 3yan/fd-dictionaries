The first release (0.1) is accompanied by 

* a file listing all POSs together with the headwords that they refer to
* a file listing the entries from the TeX version that did not make it into
  SGML and therefore are not present in the XML version (courtesy of Radek MoszczyÅ„ski)
* an XSLT script that documents the transformation from SGML (actually, an XML-ised version
  of it, with some minor fixes introduced, and with transcriptions transduced into IPA)
* a notes file that documents the process of the initial SGML->XML conversion and 
  contains hints on where to look for problems.
