  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>FreeDict is a small organisation of people who together oversee
    the publication of free translating dictionaries.  
    They are archived in a flexible<indexterm><primary>XML</primary>
    <secondary>TEI</secondary></indexterm> XML format that allows for
    further use and development.</para>

  <para>FreeDict also ensures that the dictionaries can be converted 
    into the dictd database format, that works with <application>dictd</application>
    (see http://www.dict.org./) and <application>Serpento</application> (TODO:
    make a clickable link http://melkor.dnp.fmph.uniba.sk/~garabik/serpento/)
    dictionary servers.</para>

  <para>The content of the dictionaries is left up to individual developers.
    We ourselves can't speak every language on the planet and so rely on the
    <indexterm><primary>contributing</primary> <secondary>writers</secondary></indexterm>
    contributing writers and users to produce <indexterm><primary>quality</primary></indexterm>
    high-quality, useful dictionaries. We can, however, try to ensure that
    the dictionaries are formatted and organised
    correctly, are as easy as practicable to produce and will work on free
    operating systems.</para>

  <para>You are probably reading this HOWTO, to get an idea of what is involved in
    producing a translating dictionary. The approach taken in this HOWTO is task
    oriented. We hope you can just jump to the point you are aiming at and continue
    forward. <indexterm><primary>free operating systems</primary>
