  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>FreeDict is a small organisation of people who together oversee
    the publication of free translating dictionaries.  
    They are archived in a flexible XML format that allows for
    further use and development.<indexterm><primary>XML</primary>
    <secondary>TEI</secondary></indexterm></para>

  <para>FreeDict also ensures that the dictionaries can be converted 
    into the dictd database format, that works with <application>dictd</application>
    (see <ulink url="http://www.dict.org/" id="dictd-site">http://www.dict.org</ulink>)
    and <application>Serpento</application> (<ulink url=" http://melkor.dnp.fmph.uniba.sk/~garabik/serpento/"

  </para>

  <para>The content of the dictionaries is left up to individual developers.
    We ourselves can't speak every language on the planet and so rely on the
    contributing writers and users to produce  high-quality, useful dictionaries.
    We can, however, try to ensure that the dictionaries are formatted and organised
    correctly, are as easy as practicable to produce and will work on free
    operating systems.

  <para>You are probably reading this HOWTO, to get an idea of what is involved in
    producing a translating dictionary. The approach taken in this HOWTO is task
    oriented. We hope you can just jump to the point you are aiming at and continue
    forward. <indexterm><primary>free operating systems</primary>
