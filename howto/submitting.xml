    <title>Submitting The Dictionaries</title>
    <abstract>
      <para>Having a dictionary database fulfilling the
       requirements for inclusion into FreeDict, these are the
       steps to get your dictionary into FreeDict.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Naming of the dictionary files</title>
      <para>For naming the TEI files we use the format <filename>la1-la2.tei</filename>,
        where la1 and la2 are <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm">ISO
        639</ulink> 3-letter language codes. You might also use the command
        <command>info iso639</command> to get the list.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Importing into CVS</title>
	<para>Ask a developer to import your TEI file (or the code to create
	  the TEI file from a different format) into the FreeDict CVS repository.
	  If you are a developer of FreeDict and have write access to the
	  repository, you can import using a command like
	  <command>cvs import freedict/la1-la2 vendortag releasetag</command>(?).
	  At present vendortag and releasetag are not used, but it
	  might be good to use them as intended by CVS: If you
	  import files from some upstream project, use that project's
	  name as vendortag and that project's release version as releasetag.</para>
