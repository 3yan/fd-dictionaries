    <para>A step through  installing the Text Exchange Initiative DTD's</para>
<para>Here we assume you have a working knowledge of a Linux or similar file system and command line. No advanced commands or tools are used, examples of all commands are given.</para>

    <title>Finding and Downloading The DTD's</title>
    <para>The recommended way of finding the TEI DTD set is to use your distributions package search tools.</para>
    <para>For example Debian:<command> apt-cache search TEI</command> </para>
<para>Alternatively you may find them using "RPM find" or similar package search engines.</para><para>http://rpmfind.net/</para>
<para>If your distribution has prepackaged "sets" of the TEI2 P4 DTD's please use them. Hopefully they will also automate your SGML and XML catalog set up as well. Otherwise you will need to hand install them. It's not that complex, follow the steps below.</para>
    <para>The TEI-Consortium keeps a download-able zipped set at <ulink url="&TEIdl;">&TEIdl;</ulink>. These are the the raw format files suitable for use on just about any platform.<indexterm><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>XML</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>RPM</primary></indexterm></para>

  <section id="installingIntro">
    <title>Installing</title>
 <para>If you used a "binary package" you might be able to skip this section. Your TEI DTD's should be  installed somewhere under /usr/share. Hopefully your Catalogs were also set up for you. If you are installing from the zip file you have a little more work to do.</para>
      <para>First you have to make a decision. Do you want to install these so other users may use them?</para><para> If not you can install them anywhere you have write permissions. If so install them under /usr/local/share. You will need administrator level permissions to do so.</para><para> (so pass them to your local administrator and ask them to set everything up for you :) ) OK in real life it goes like this...<indexterm><primary>binary packages</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>permissions</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>Catalogs</primary></indexterm> </para>

	<title>System Wide Install</title>
	<para>This is no more difficult than undertaking a user only install. The difficult part is knowing where to install them. </para>
	<para>After some trial and error, reference to the Linux File Hierarchy Standard, and various Debian docs I decided to install these DTD's as an SGML based technology. The other sensible choice would be to install as an XML technology however there are some advantages to doing this set of DTD's the "old way". <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>The TEI DTD's are still really SGML based. The ENTITY inclusions are very clever at mapping the SGML entities to XML compliance, but the underlying engine is still SGML</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>The SGML catalog system is still flexible (and non validating) and so gives you more options for now. (Though I will say that this was a pathetic reason).</para>
	      
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Given a reasonable DOCTYPE string and catalog set up. Current XML SGML editors should be able to find the DTD's without user level interdiction. </para>
	      
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>This leaves the XML working space clean of TEI SGML technologies</para>
	     
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>It's easy enough to symlink back from the XML tree to the SGML tree if required. (and Visa Versa). So both catalog systems can be utilised. The zip package contains catalog files for both systems. Functionally you lose nothing.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Installing under /usr/local stays out of the way of package management tools.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</para>
	<para>So we need to install to <filename>/usr/local/share/sgml/tei2/p4/</filename> (by the above reasoning). Install anywhere you like of course, the rest of this document will assume you installed as above though. I have not put a ///dtd/ directory in the path as all the files needed need be in the same directory for simplicity. i.e. It would involve rewriting the local TEI level catalogs as well, which would just be redundant and, well, dumb.</para>
	<para> <example>
	    <title>Administrator Install</title>
<orderedlist>
	    <title>Suggested Local SGML Install</title>
	    <listitem>
		<para><command>mkdir -p /usr/local/share/sgml/tei2/p4</command></para></listitem>
	     
	    <listitem>
		<para><command>cp dtd.zip /usr/local/share/sgml/tei2/p4/</command></para></listitem>
	    <listitem>
		<para><command>cd /usr/local/share/sgml/tei2/p4/</command></para></listitem>
	    <listitem>
		<para><command>unzip dtd.zip</command></para></listitem>
	    <listitem>
		<para><command>rm dtd.zip</command></para></listitem></orderedlist></example> </para>
	<para>OK now everybody may access the TEI2 DTD's. Especially if the catalogs are also set up... You may also symlink to the appropriate place under /usr/local/share/xml/ or else where. If you do so, I strongly suggest you mirror your package managements file system structure. The catalog system described below assumes you haven't. Only do it if you need to. (sheeze life is hard enough) <indexterm><primary>administrator</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>catalog</primary></indexterm> </para>

      <title>Your System Catalog Files</title>
    <para>To automate detection of your newly installed DTD's you need to set up your catalog systems to reflect the state of your XML and SGML trees. Please work on / keep originals as copies, at least until you have tested it all few times. (Check you don't break DocBook for example.) Here we are going to do this all by hand. There are tools to automate this. However they seem to be distribution dependant and on Debian at least are in a state of change. (Feb 2004). </para>
      <para>The SGML catalog system uses layers of catalog files to map to your local DTD (and other lower level SGML files). The Highest level file is called the <filename>"Super Catalog"</filename> and lives under <filename>/etc/sgml</filename>. The next level down  is called the <filename>"Central Catalog"</filename> and it also normally lives under <filename>/etc/sgml</filename>. The final catalog may be with the particular set of SGML "engine room" files way down deep in the file system. This is often called the <filename>"Application Catalog" or the "Local Catalog"</filename>.</para>
      <para>What all these catalogs do is map the canonical DTD's (the planet wide ones) to your local system. If it helps just consider them as a series of includes. The XML system is similar to this, though a little more efficient at run time. When you ask to use a DTD the catalog system checks identifiers in the prolog of the document and finds the correct match for you. One of the clever things about this is that the matching file need not be on your computer, but here we will assume it is.<indexterm><primary>prolog</primary></indexterm></para>

</note>
	<para>First we need to edit the TEI2 application level catalog:<filename> /usr/local/share/sgml/tei2/p4/catalog.tei</filename>. Open the file in a good text editor, read the instructions  in the commented out head section. (SGML Comments are two dashes like so : -- ) Do a replace as per the instructions.

Check the install path is the same as yours. <indexterm><primary>SGML comments</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>catalog</primary></indexterm></para>

    	Before use 
	YOU MUST  REPLACE THE STRING
