This database is not related to the existing (and presently
small) tur-eng FreeDict database.

The data was taken from the GPL program gtksozluk2:

Original Turkish files were encoded in ISO 8859-9.

Original Author: Mehmet Ali Vardar <ali@linuxprogramlama.com>

The converter splits Turkish entries at ";" characters to separate
senses. It also separates translation equivalents at ","
characters. But this should not be done, since it may split too
aggressively (at wrong places).

After the eng-tur.tei file was made, `make validation` complains:

> nsgmls:eng-tur.tei:136233:13:E: non SGML character number 149

The offending character was subsituted by a "'".
