This database is not related to the existing (and presently
small tur-eng FreeDict database).

The data was taken from the GPL program gtksozluk2:

Original turkish files were encoded as ISO 8859-9.

Original author: Mehmet Ali Vardar <ali@linuxprogramlama.com>

The converter splits turkish entries at ";" characters to separate
senses. It also does separate translation equivalents at ","
characters. But this should not be done maybe...

After the eng-tur.tei file was made, `make validation` complains:

> nsgmls:eng-tur.tei:136233:13:E: non SGML character number 149

The offending character was subsituted by a "'".

The, in line 14619 is an "&" character that was not properly encoded
by the perl conversion script:

xsltproc ../tools/xsl/getedition.xsl eng-tur.tei
eng-tur.tei:14619: error: xmlParseEntityRef: no name
