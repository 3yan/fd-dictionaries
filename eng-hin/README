The database for this English-Hindi dictionary is
taken from the Anusaaraka project, English-Hindi
dictionary V2.0, see
http://www.iiit.net/ltrc/Dictionaries/Dict_Downld.html
and is in GPL as it was. It has more than 25 600
headwords and low quality.

As that text file was made by school children and
non-IT professionals, it was in a very bad shape.
The file looked ok in an editor, but not to a parser,
because there were spaces where they shouldn't be and
many other format exceptions. So only after some manual
editing of that file, the parser has accepted it.
Those differences are in the .diff file.

The file in this package has the diff already applied.

ehconv.yy is a parser. It is compiled with flex
and will convert the text database file, which is
encoded in ISCII into a TEI P4 xml file, encoded in
utf8, see http://www.tei-c.org/ and http://unicode.org/.
For more information about ISCII, see
http://tdil.mit.gov.in/standards.htm and
http://www.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/indic.html (beware,
the tables use octal codes!).

The final step of converting the .tei file into
.dict format is done using tei2dict_xml.pl.

Now take your unicode compatible dict server
and client and enjoy the nice devanagari!

As the Anusaaraka project aimed at machine aided
translation between many Indian languages, there are
several other dictionaries available at
http://www.iiit.net/ltrc/Dictionaries/Dict_Frame.html.
Btw, the dict here is _not_ the Shabdanjali English-Hindi
dictionary! Also, for each dictionary there is
further information at the IIIT server.

There is much scope for future work :)

If your dict client/browser don't support devanagari rendering,
you could translate everything into roman encoding:
uniconv -encode IS_DV -in eng-hin.tei  | uniconv -decode IS_RM >eng-hin.roman.tei
(uniconv is part of the great yudit package). But there is
one thing not working: uniconv cannot count syllables and so
creates an 'a' too much sometimes in the transliteration :(
(also, iscii code e5 becomes "o with a bar on top"
as well as   code e1 becomes "e ..." -> i substitute simple "o" and "e" for them
