Most of the documentation can be found in the FreeDict HOWTO at

    https://github.com/freedict/fd-dictionaries/wiki/FreeDict-HOWTO

In general, it is a good idea to have a look at our wiki at
    
    https://github.com/freedict/fd-dictionaries/wiki

The following lines may get you started on some requirements:

FreeDict databases are encoded in the TEI XML format (chapter 9), see
<http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html>.

The conversion is based on XSL stylesheets (see directory `xsl/`). These can in
principle transform to any format, but only the .dict format is supported at the
moment.

You should have at least the following tools installed, to build the
dictionaries: make, xsltproc, tar, gzip, dictzip, dictfmt

For proper use of all our tools, Perl, Python > 3.4, Git and a XML-capable
editor are strongly advised.

In order to build source release files (freedict-*-*-*.src.tar.bz2,
containing *-*.tei), run:

 cd tools
 mkdir -p ../../release/src
 make dist

In order to build binary release files (freedict-*-*-*.tar.bz2,
containing *-*.dict.dz and *-*.index), run:

 cd tools
 mkdir -p ../../release/dict-tbz2
 make release-dict-tbz2

In order to create eng-deu.{dict,index} from
freedict-eng-deu-0.3.src.tar.bz2, run:

 tar jxf freedict-eng-deu-0.3.src.tar.bz2
 cd eng-deu
 FREEDICTDIR=path/to/freedict/root make

where path/to/freedict should contain tools/Makefile.common.


Debian/Ubuntu Dependencies
--------------------------

If you use Debian/Ubuntu, you should install the following packages:

    sudo apt-get install dbview unzip xsltproc libxml-libxml-perl python3

Also, teiaddphonetics requires XML::LibXML::Reader, which is not even
in libxml-libxml-perl in unstable, so you need to do as root:

	cpan XML::LibXML
